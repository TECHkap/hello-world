# hello-world
info folder, GIT Presentation
In This Folder i would keep you inform about my plans in the next week. The Idea behind my Git is to share with you all small and simple python scripts for daily tasks (Engineer, Data Analyst, ...)
I would upload new scripts weekly/monthly (depending on my availibilities ☺️)
some ideas for the next weeks:
1 --- Excel_Merger.py
2 --- Random_questioner.py
3 --- ... please feel free to give me some ideas what you need or think it can help the community
