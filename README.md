# hello-world
info folder, GIT Presentation

In This Folder i would keep you inform about my plans in the next weeks. The Idea behind my Git is to share with you all small and simple python scripts for daily tasks (Computer Vision, Data Analyst, ...)
I would upload new scripts weekly/monthly (depending on my mood ☺️)


some ideas for the next weeks:

1 --- CV_classifier.py for football (soccer) use cases

2 --- CNN_Classifier.py for football (soccer) use cases

3 --- CNN_Regression.py

4 --- ... please feel free to give me some ideas what you need or think it can help the community
